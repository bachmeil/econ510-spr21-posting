<div id="1" style="display: none">Announcement 1: We will have our first in-person meeting of the semester on Feb 18. This will be a review for Quiz 1. It's in <b>Ackert 120</b>.
<br><br>
I checked out the room. It has chalkboards, which will work.</div>

<div id="2" style="display: none">
I will have to divide you into two groups. We'll see things work out this time.
<br><br>
The in-person meeting will be a 30-minute review session where I work through and answer questions in preparation for the quiz. <u>We'll have one review start at 1:05 and the other start at 1:50.</u> That will leave us with a 15-minute intermission to clean and for the new group to enter.
<br><br>
In the future we may do it differently, but for this quiz 30 minutes is more than enough. I want to be able to have a live Zoom meeting on Tuesday.

Announcement 2: Quiz 1 is coming up on Tuesday, Feb 23. It will be online. Details will be provided as we get closer to the date.
<br><br>
The way I set this up is intentional. You take the quiz after we introduce the goods market model of chapter 3.
<br><br>
 The first quiz is not designed to be tough. It's designed to <u>provide feedback on how you're preparing</u>. Not everyone does well. It's only 15% of your grade though, so if you get a 60%, it doesn't completely destroy your grade. Many of the students that do poorly on Quiz 1 go on to do well on the midterm, which is a lot harder.

I assume you've worked through Module 4. That's like the first 30 minutes of this week's lecture.

I did it this way because I try to be careful about hitting you with too much material at one time. It's hard to process everything in a 75-minute session. This way your brain has had time to work through the simpler things before I hit you with this.

Chapter 3 develops what we call the <b>goods market model</b>. We want to develop a formal model of <u>the amount all firms in the economy produce</u>. That in turn determines the demand for workers and the amount that's consumed.

We assume that in the short run, firms will produce as much as is demanded. If people want to buy 10 more blue Ford Explorers, then Ford produces an additional 10 blue Ford Explorers.

Output is said to be <b>demand determined</b>.
<br><br>
You might think demand determined output is rather obvious. You might ask how anything else could ever possibly be the case. 
<br><br>
Consider the case of a Taylor Swift concert. 
<br><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift" target="_blank">Behold Taylor Swift</a>
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(10)">10</button>
<div id="10" style="display: none">
Taylor Swift is pretty popular.
<br><br>
If you have a Taylor Swift concert in the Manhattan High School gym, there are only a few seats available relative to the number of people that would like to attend. It would sell out immediately.
<br><br>
If the demand for Taylor Swift tickets increases, are they going to produce more? They can't, because <u>there are no more tickets to make</u>. In that case, they're going to raise the price, since they don't need to sell to everyone. They now have a few more crazy people that will pay an outrageous price for a ticket.

This is an example of an <b>output ceiling</b>. It's not possible to increase production.
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(11)">11</button>
<div id="11" style="display: none">
In other cases, firms might see a profit opportunity.
<br><br>
If a tornado knocks out power to thousands of people, some retailers might take advantage of the situation to double the price of generators. From an economic perspective, this is neither good nor bad, though you might have your own personal views on the morality of doing something like that.
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(12)">12</button>
<div id="12" style="display: none">
This is an example where there's a lot of profit to be had from raising the price because there's not enough time to produce new generators, so <u>the supply is fixed</u> over the time frame people need generators.
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide('13')">13</button>
<div id="13" style="display: none">
In practice, neither of these scenarios seems to describe most of our interactions. We mostly don't see fixed supply or output ceilings.
<br><br>
Firms tend to change prices slowly when demand changes. <u>If firms raise their price when demand rises, there's no reason to expect changes in demand to lead to changes in production</u>. If you look at the data, you don't see prices rising when demand rises.
<br><br>
One of the reasons cited by managers is that raising prices makes customers upset. They don't want to try to profit from a small surge in demand, because everyone that pays higher prices today will curse them and buy from a competitor in the future.
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide('14')">14</button>
<div id="14" style="display: none">
This is the observation of <i>sticky prices</i>.
<br><br>
That observation is the foundation for everything we'll do in chapters 3-5. We make the assumption that <u>firms don't change prices at all when there's a change in demand</u>. We'll relax that assumption later in the semester.
<br><br>
The <b>equilibrium condition</b> is that GDP, the amount firms produce, is exactly equal to the amount demanded. We can draw the equilibrium as what you might have heard called the 45-degree line.

<button onclick="showSlide(19)">19</button>
<div id="19" style="display: none">
We've now defined all of the possible equilibrium amounts of production. That only tells us which levels of production <i>can</i> be an equilibrium. We now need to describe the behavior underlying demand so we can determine <i>which</i> level of production will be chosen.

Demand equation

Z = C + I + G
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(21)">21</button>
<div id="21" style="display: none">
It turns out that demand depends on GDP. <u>A higher level of GDP means disposable income is higher, which in turn means consumption is higher</u>. We can define the <b>aggregate consumption function</b> in terms of GDP. The aggregate consumption function differs from the one you saw in the module in two ways:

<ul>
	<li>It describes all consumption in the economy rather than consumption for one person.</li>
	<li>The aggregate MPC can be different from the individual MPC (and indeed, is different, because everyone has their own MPC). The aggregate MPC is how much aggregate consumption rises if GDP rises by $1. It has to be less than one.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(22)">22</button>
<div id="22" style="display: none">
I'm going to deviate just a bit from the book to make this distinction clear. I'm going to use the aggregate consumption function
<br><br>
C = a + b Y
<br><br>
where C is aggregate consumption, a is aggregate autonomous consumption, b is the aggregate MPC, and Y is GDP. The author does not have a or b in his aggregate consumption function.
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(23)">23</button>
<div id="23" style="display: none">
The equation for total demand depends on its three components:
<br><br>
Z = C + I + G
<br><br>
Plugging in from the previous slide for consumption, we have:
<br><br>
Z = a + bY + I + G
<br><br>
so now demand depends on the value of GDP.
</div>
<button onclick="showSlide(24)">24</button>
<div id="24" style="display: none">
Suppose we have (in billions)
<br><br>
C = 100 + 0.75Y
<br>
I = 300
<br>
G = 100
<br><br>
Then demand is given by (using some middle school calculations)
<br><br>
Z = 100 + 0.75Y + 300 + 100
<br>
Z = (100 + 300 + 100) + 0.75Y

Z = 500 + 0.75Y

Let's graph this thing. The thing to note at the start is that <u>aggregate autonomous consumption has to be greater than 0</u>. Therefore the intercept of the demand curve has to be above the equilibrium line.
