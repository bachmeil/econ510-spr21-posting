<div id="correctanswer1" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b>  Exports are inflows to the US. Imports are outflows for the US. Exports were smaller than imports, so we ran a trade deficit. 2808 - 2127 = 681 billion trade deficit. That means trade caused a -681 billion net inflow or +681 billion net outflow. (A net inflow is the negative of a net outflow, all you're doing is flipping the sign.)

<div id="question2" class="question" style="display: none;"><b>US income from foreign investments (US-owned businesses in other countries) had income of $958 billion. Foreign income from US investments (foreign-owned businesses in the US) was $776 billion. Was this a net inflow or a net outflow for the US? In what amount?</b><br><br>

<div id="correctanswer2" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b> When US-owned businesses in other countries make a profit, that's an inflow for the US, since that's money coming back into the US. This would represent a net inflow for the US in the amount of 958 - 776 = $182 billion.

<div id="question3" class="question" style="display: none;"><b>If net transfers were $50 billion, calculate the current account balance, and be sure to state if it represents (a) a deficit or surplus, and (b) an inflow or outflow.</b><br><br>

<br><br>
<div id="noanswer3" style="display: none;">Please enter your answer<br><br></div>
<div id="correctanswer3" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b> The trade component was a $681 billion outflow for the US. Investment income was an inflow of $182 billion for the US. We know net transfers are an outflow for the US. We have:
  <ul>
<li>$681 billion outflow</li>
<li>$182 billion inflow</li>
<li>$50 billion outflow</li>
<li>Total: $549 billion outflow due to the current account. This is a deficit.</li>
</ul>

<div id="question4" class="question" style="display: none;"><b>Given the information above, what can you infer about the capital account? Do you expect that the US was borrowing from other countries/selling assets to other countries, or that the US was lending to other countries/buying assets from other countries? State the amount.</b><br><br>
<textarea id="youranswer4" rows="3" cols="60"></textarea>
<br><br>
<div id="noanswer4" style="display: none;">Please enter your answer<br><br></div>
<div id="correctanswer4" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b> If the US had a current account deficit of $549 billion, the US had a capital account surplus of $549 billion to pay for it. That is an inflow to the US. The US has to borrow from other countries and sell businesses to other countries in order to pay for the current account deficit.
