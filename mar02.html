<h1>Vaccination</h1>
<p>The unemployment rate will be a bad indicator of the labor market for the next year.</p>
<p>Number of people not in the labor force (millions)
<ul>
<li>Feb 2020: 95</li>
<li>Apr 2020: 103</li>
<li>Today: 101</li>
</ul>
There's still a gap of <u>5-6 million people</u> that left the labor force due to childcare issues, being at high risk, or interacting with high risk people.
</p>
</div><button id="button-9" onclick="showSlide('9');">9</button>
<div id="9" style="display: none;">
<h1>Vaccination</h1>
<p>The unemployment rate is back down to 6.3%, but that doesn't mean much.</p>
<p>Take the unemployment level (currently at <u>10 million</u>) add in the 6 million people post-vaccination (bumping it to <u>16 million</u>) and divide by the labor force (currently <u>160 million</u>).</p>
<p>The "true" unemployment rate is 16 million / 160 million = <b>10%</b>.</p>
</div><button id="button-10" onclick="showSlide('10');">10</button>
<div id="10" style="display: none;">
<h1>Vaccination</h1>
<p>The unemployment rate is likely to rise quite a bit as workers return to the labor force. There will be a window of only <b>2-3 months</b> where those 5-6 million workers become eligible to reenter the labor force.</p>
<p>It will take time for them to find work so they will be counted as unemployed.</p>

<h1>Ricardian Equivalence</h1>
<p>You always have to account for the GBC when analyzing the effect of a change in fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Spending = <b>Tax revenue + Net Borrowing - Net Transfers</b></p>
<p>When there's a tax cut, it has to be paid for by
<ul>
<li>Cutting spending</li>
<li>Increasing borrowing</li>
<li>Cutting transfers</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div><button id="button-12" onclick="showSlide('12');">12</button>
<div id="12" style="display: none;">
<h1>Cutting Spending</h1>
<p>Cut taxes to increase demand</p>
<p>Spending (-100) = Tax revenue (-100) + Net Borrowing - Net Transfers</p>
<p>Pay for it by cutting highway maintenance: Offsetting decrease in demand</p>
<p>This makes no sense as a form of fiscal policy!</p>
</div><button id="button-13" onclick="showSlide('13');">13</button>
<div id="13" style="display: none;">
<h1>Cutting transfers</h1>
<p>Cut taxes to increase demand</p>
<p>Spending = Tax revenue (-100) + Net Borrowing - Net Transfers (-100)</p>
<p>Pay for it by cutting Social Security payments by an equal amount: Offsetting decrease in demand</p>
<p>This is also a policy that makes no sense!</p>
</div><button id="button-14" onclick="showSlide('14');">14</button>
<div id="14" style="display: none;">
<h1>Borrow More</h1>
<p>Cut taxes to increase demand</p>
<p>Spending = Tax revenue (-100) + Net Borrowing (+100) - Net Transfers</p>
<p>Pay for it by selling bonds that will be repaid in 30 years.</p>
<p>The <u>only</u> option for fiscal policy is if it involves government debt. <u>No other fiscal policy can influence demand.</u></p>
</div><button id="button-15" onclick="showSlide('15');">15</button>
<div id="15" style="display: none;">
<h1>Ricardian Equivalence</h1>
<p>The surprising result known as <i>Ricardian equivalence</i> says even the last option has no effect on demand.</p>
<p>Borrowing implies future taxes to repay the debt.</p>
<p>Tax cuts funded by borrowing are a change in the <u>timing</u> of taxes, not a change in your lifetime tax burden.</p>
</div><button id="button-16" onclick="showSlide('16');">16</button>
<div id="16" style="display: none;">
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>A government agent hands you a $10 bill. It's yours to keep. In <u>one minute</u>, you have to repay the $10 or go to jail for the rest of your life.</p>

<h1>Why Ricardian equivalence fails</h1>
<p>In practice, Ricardian equivalence fails to some extent, and tax cuts do cause GDP to rise in the short run.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might not expect to be alive when the tax bill comes due.
  <ul>
  <li>One minute vs one century</li>
  <li>If you care about giving your kids an inheritance, you might care about policy in one century.</li>
  <li>Most of us will never pay the inheritance tax so what happens in a century doesn't tax your wealth in the US.</li>
  </ul></li>

<h1>Add government borrowing plus a check</h1>
<p>You can't borrow, but the government can borrow and send you the money, and <u>that's just as good</u>.</p>
<p>Since you want to consume more, you'll spend the money, and demand and GDP will increase.</p>
<p>A long-time argument against tuition subsidies is that students will spend the money on beer, pizza, and such.</p>

<p>Ricardian equivalence is not only a statement that people will save a tax cut or transfer. They'll do so <u>in order to pay their future taxes</u>. </p>
<p>There are lots of good reasons to save a tax cut/transfer even if you don't care about your future taxes.</p>
