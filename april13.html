<h1>Homework 6 Solutions</h1>
<p>Recall that homework 5 is due Thursday.</p>
</div><button id="button-3" onclick="showSlide('3');">3</button>
<div id="3" style="display: none;">
<p>1. You have $10,000 in savings. You want to hold the savings for one year. You are considering holding a US bond or holding a German bond. The US interest rate is 5%. If you buy the US bond, how many dollars will you have after one year?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b> 1.05($10,000) = $10,5000</p>
</div><button id="button-4" onclick="showSlide('4');">4</button>
<div id="4" style="display: none;">
<p>2. You decide to buy the German bond. Suppose the exchange rate is such that you have to give up $1.25 to get one euro.

<li>a. How many euros worth of bonds can you buy today with your $10,000?</li>

<li>b. How many euros will you have on repayment in one year if the German interest rate is 5%?</li>

<li>c. How many dollars will you have in one year if you convert the proceeds from (b) into dollars at an exchange rate of $1.25 per euro.</li>
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b> a. 8000 euros b. 1.05(8000) = 8400 euros c. $1.25/euro(8400 euros) = $10,500</p>
</div><button id="button-5" onclick="showSlide('5');">5</button>
<div id="5" style="display: none;">
<p>3. You decide to buy the German bond. Suppose the exchange rate is such that you have to give up $1.25 to get one euro.

<li>a. How many euros worth of bonds can you buy today with your $10,000?</li>

<li>b. How many euros will you have on repayment in one year if the German interest rate is 8%?</li>

<li>c. How many dollars will you have in one year if you convert the proceeds from (b) into dollars at an exchange rate of $1.215 per euro.</li>
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b> a. 8000 euros b. 8640 euros c. $10,497.60</p>
</div><button id="button-6" onclick="showSlide('6');">6</button>
<div id="6" style="display: none;">
<p>4. You decide to buy the German bond. Suppose the exchange rate is such that you have to give up $1.25 to get one euro.

<li>a. How many euros worth of bonds can you buy today with your $10,000?</li>

<li>b. How many euros will you have on repayment in one year if the German interest rate is 2%?</li>

<li>c. How many dollars will you have in one year if you convert the proceeds from (b) into dollars at an exchange rate of $1.287 per euro.</li>
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b> a. 8000 euros b. 8160 euros c. $10,501.92</p>
</div><button id="button-7" onclick="showSlide('7');">7</button>
<div id="7" style="display: none;">
<p>In all cases, buying the German bond results in $10,500 (plus rounding error) after one year.</p>
</div><button id="button-8" onclick="showSlide('8');">8</button>
<div id="8" style="display: none;">
<h1>IS/LM and the Exchange Rate</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Cut the money supply (LM shifts up)</li>
  <li>Send checks to everyone (IS shifts right)</li>
  <li>Lower consumer confidence (IS shifts left)</li>
</ul>

<p>&#10112; Interest rate determines the demand for the dollar. High demand means E rises.</p>
<p>&#10113; Prices of goods don't change in the short run, so the real exchange rate rises.</p>
<p>&#10114; High real exchange rate hurts exporters.</p>
</div><button id="button-9" onclick="showSlide('9');">9</button>
<div id="9" style="display: none;">
<h1>US Imports</h1>

<p>What determines how much the US imports from other countries?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real exchange rate</li>
  <li>US GDP (total US consumption)</li>
</ul>
<p>As the US economy expands, we purchase more goods made in other countries.</p>
<p>Expanding imports is generally a sign that the US economy is strong. The opposite for weak import numbers.</p>
<p>Business confidence matters: If we're producing lots of investment goods, that output can't be consumed.</p>
<p>You can fill the "consumption gap" this leaves by importing.</p>
<p>Exports: If we're producing export goods (agriculture) then we're not consuming those goods. Imports will again fill that gap.</p>

<p><a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMPGSC1' target='_blank'>https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMPGSC1</a></p>

<p>Of course, the real exchange rate matters a lot too: <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RBUSBIS' target='_blank'>https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RBUSBIS</a></p>

<p>Changes in the real exchange rate are typically different: They cause a shift from domestic production to imports and vice versa.</p>

<div id="10" style="display: none;">
<h1>Spillovers</h1>

<p>International Spillover: Effect of a shock in one economy has an effect on other economies.</p>

<p>An expansion of the US economy causes Canadian GDP to rise.</p>

<p>Goods market model for Canada: Demand shifts up, causing GDP to rise.</p>
</div><button id="button-11" onclick="showSlide('11');">11</button>
<div id="11" style="display: none;">
<h1>US Exports</h1>

<p>What determines how much the US imports from other countries?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real exchange rate</li>
  <li>Foreign GDP (total foreign consumption)</li>
</ul>

<p>Exports are more sensitive to the real exchange rate since they go to many other countries.</p>

<p>Goods market model for the US if Canada's economy grows.</p>

<p>Goods market model for the US if the real exchange rate rises.</p>

<p>Monetary policy is extremely important for US exporters</p>
</div><button id="button-12" onclick="showSlide('12');">12</button>
<div id="12" style="display: none;">
<h1>International Business Cycles</h1>

<p>These spillovers lead to an <i>international business cycle</i>. Countries* tend to have similar recessions and expansions due to international trade.</p>

<p>* Other than Australia.</p>
</div><button id="button-13" onclick="showSlide('13');">13</button>
<div id="13" style="display: none;">
<h1>Incentive to Wait</h1>

<p>Spillovers introduce a problem for monetary policy in small open countries.</p>

<p>Suppose the economy of Honduras goes into a recession. They can:
<ul>
  <li>Increase the money supply: Higher GDP, more imports</li>
  <li>Wait for the US to increase the money supply: Higher GDP, more exports</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Consider fiscal policy in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Policy coordination</i>: Countries promise to use policy to help the world/regional economy.</p>

<p>These agreements lack an <i>enforcement mechanism</i>.</p>
</div><button id="button-14" onclick="showSlide('14');">14</button>
<div id="14" style="display: none;">
<h1>Common Currency Area</h1>

<p>A common currency area is a region (typically a group of countries) that use the same currency.</p>

<p>Countries like Ecuador and El Salvador use the US dollar as their currency. CCA with the US because you can travel there without changing your money.</p>

<p>What are the advantages?
  <ul>
    <li>You can travel to Ecuador without the cost of currency conversion.</li>
    <li>There is no exchange rate risk for US companies doing business in Ecuador.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>What's the disadvantage? Ecuador cannot use monetary policy if it goes into a recession.</p>

<p>Whether to share a currency depends heavily on how monetary policy is set and the amount of risk if you don't.</p>

<p>The <i>optimum currency area</i> is the currency area that makes the most sense for everyone.</p>
</div><button id="button-15" onclick="showSlide('15');">15</button>
<div id="15" style="display: none;">
<h1>Euro</h1>

<p>The Euro is used by a bunch of countries in Europe as a common currency. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro' target='_blank'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro</a></p>

<p>Don't confuse it with the EU or European Union. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union' target='_blank'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union</a></p>

<p>Brexit is the UK pulling out of the EU, not the euro. They never adopted the euro as their currency.</p>
</div><button id="button-16" onclick="showSlide('16');">16</button>
<div id="16" style="display: none;">
<h1>Troubles of the Euro</h1>

<p>Compare Spain in 2010-2014: <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSCAB1GQES' target='_blank'>https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSCAB1GQES</a></p>

<p>Against Germany in 2010-2014: <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSCAB1GQDE' target='_blank'>https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSCAB1GQDE</a></p>

<p>The European Central Bank is responsible for their monetary policy. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank' target='_blank'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank</a> Do they care more about Germany or Spain?</p>

<p>Monetary policy for all countries is determined by the country with the most political power.</p>
</div><button id="button-17" onclick="showSlide('17');">17</button>
<div id="17" style="display: none;">
<h1>Debt Crises</h1>

<p>Government borrowing:
  <li>Low existing debt levels (no risk)</li>
  <li>Moderate debt levels (slight risk)</li>
  <li>Extremely high debt levels (certain default): Crisis!</li>
</p>

<p>Moderate debt + large recession: Get rid of those bonds.</p>

<p>Case of Greece: Get rid of bonds <i>and</i> the euro.</p>

<p>Greek debt selloff would spill over to all other euro-using countries.</p>

<p>"Updated" deficit numbers for 2009:
  <li>April 2009: 4% of GDP</li>
  <li>Oct 2009: 6%</li>
  <li>April 2010: 13%</li>
  <li>Oct 2010: 15.6%</li>
</p>

<p>Choice for other countries:
  <li>Bailout (bad precedent)</li>
  <li>No bailout (currency crisis)</li>
</p>
