Ted is 55, has an income of $80,000 per year, expects that same income until retirement in ten years, will have a pension of $60,000 per year in retirement, and plans to live until 85. Calculate Ted’s lifetime income.<br><br>
</textarea>
<textarea id="q1answer" style="display: none;">
lifetime income = 10($80,000) + 20($60,000) = $2,000,000

Ted is 55, has an income of $80,000 per year, expects that same income until retirement in ten years, will have a pension of $60,000 per year in retirement, and plans to live until 85. Calculate Ted’s spending each year while working an in retirement, assuming Ted prefers consumption smoothing.<br><br>

Ted lives 30 years, has $2,000,000 in lifetime income, and prefers to consume the same each year:
<br><br>
$2,000,000/30 = $66,667/year consumption
</textarea>
<textarea id="q3" style="display: none;">
Ted is 55, has an income of $80,000 per year, expects that same income until retirement in ten years, will have a pension of $60,000 per year in retirement, and plans to live until 85. Calculate Ted’s savings while working and in retirement.<br><br>
</textarea>
<textarea id="q3answer" style="display: none;">
While working, Ted saves
<br><br>
$80,000 - $66,667 = $13,333/year
<br><br>
While retired, Ted saves
<br><br>
$60,000 - $66,667 = -$6667/year
<br><br>
Negative savings mean spending out of retirement savings. In this example, Ted is able to do a perfect job of consumption smoothing as long as he lives to be 85. If he lives longer than that, he’ll only be able to consume $60,000 per year. If he lives less than that he won’t care about any of this because he won’t be around anyway.<br><br>
$2,000,000/30 = $66,667/year consumption
</textarea>
<textarea id="q4" style="display: none;">
Ted is 55, has an income of $80,000 per year, expects that same income until retirement in ten years, will have a pension of $60,000 per year in retirement, and plans to live until 85. Ted is unemployed this year because of the coronavirus. He expects to be out of work for a year and then return to his $80,000 per year salary. Calculate Ted’s lifetime income.<br><br>
</textarea>
<textarea id="q4answer" style="display: none;">
Previously, Ted had $2,000,000 in lifetime income. Now he loses a year of income at $80,000, so his updated lifetime income is
<br><br>
$2,000,000 - $80,000 = $1,920,000
</textarea>
<textarea id="q5" style="display: none;">
Ted is 55, has an income of $80,000 per year, expects that same income until retirement in ten years, will have a pension of $60,000 per year in retirement, and plans to live until 85. Ted is unemployed this year because of the coronavirus. He expects to be out of work for a year and then return to his $80,000 per year salary. Calculate Ted’s consumption this year.<br><br>
</textarea>
<textarea id="q5answer" style="display: none;">
His spending per year is
<br><br>
$1,920,000/30 = $64,000 per year
<br><br>
Ted still lives another 30 years. Because of consumption smoothing, he consumes $64,000 per year for the rest of his life. His consumption doesn’t drop much even though his income this year dropped to $0.</textarea>
