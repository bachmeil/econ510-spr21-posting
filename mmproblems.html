<div id="question4" class="question" style="display: none;"><b>Suppose total savings in the economy is given by this function (in billions of dollars):<br><br>savings = 100 + 5i,<br><br>where i is the interest rate in percentage terms (for instance, i=5 means an interest rate of 5%, not 0.05). Calculate total savings for an interest rate of 2%, 8% and 20%. Does the change in savings as the interest rate changes make sense?</b><br><br>

<br><br>
<div id="noanswer4" style="display: none;">Please enter your answer<br><br></div>
<div id="correctanswer4" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b> At 2%: savings = 100 + 5(2) = $110 billion<br>At 8%: savings = 100 + 5(8) = $140 billion<br>At 20%: savings = 100 + 5(20) = $200 billion<br><br>As the interest rate rises, savings rises. That is what we expect to happen. A higher interest rate gives people an incentive to postpone their consumption in order to capitalize on the greater amount they'll be able to consume in the future.

<div id="question5" class="question" style="display: none;"><b>Suppose banks are initially making $120 billion of loans based on business demand for operating loans. What interest rate are they paying, given the information in the previous problem?</b><br><br>
<textarea id="youranswer5" rows="3" cols="60"></textarea>
<br><br>
<div id="noanswer5" style="display: none;">Please enter your answer<br><br></div>
<div id="correctanswer5" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b> In order to be making $120 billion of loans, banks need people to be saving $120 billion. Plugging into the equation, we have<br><br>120 = 100 + 5i<br><br>and solving for i, we find that the interest rate had to have been 4%.

<div id="question6" class="question" style="display: none;"><b>Businesses suddenly want to borrow more than before. They now want $160 billion of loans rather than the $120 billion from before. In order to accommodate this, what happens to the interest rate?</b><br><br>
<textarea id="youranswer6" rows="3" cols="60"></textarea>
<br><br>
<div id="noanswer6" style="display: none;">Please enter your answer<br><br></div>
<div id="correctanswer6" style="display: none;"><b>Answer:</b> We know the interest rate has to rise. In order to make more loans, banks will need more deposits, and the only way that happens is if the interest rate rises enough to make people save that additional amount. Going back to the equation, we have<br><br>160 = 100 + 5i<br><br>telling us that i has to rise from 4% to 12% if banks want to make the additional loans.
